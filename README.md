autobench
=========

`autobench` is a framework to compare the performance of Go 1.1 and Go 1.2.

usage
-----

`autobench` downloads and builds the latest Go 1.1 and Go tip branches and runs a set of Go 1 benchmarks for comparison.

Useful targets are
	
    make bench		# runs all benchmarks, _once_
    make go1 		# runs bench/go1 benchmarks _once_
    make runtime 	# runs bench/runtime benchmarks _once_
    make http	 	# runs bench/http benchmarks _once_
    make float	 	# runs bench/float benchmarks _once_
    make clean 		# removes any previous benchmark results
    make update		# updates both branches to the latest revision, clears any benchmark results

You can optionally benchmark with gccgo instead of gc by either uncommenting the corresponding line in the Makefile or by setting TESTFLAGS to an appropriate value:

    make TESTFLAGS=-compiler=gcc bench

known issues
------------

 * If you are using OS X 10.8 and/or have upgraded to XCode 5, your system no longer has a gcc compiler and so will not work with Go 1.1's cgo package. The best workaround is to invoke `autobench` with `env CGO_ENABLED=0 make $TARGET` to avoid compiling Go with cgo enabled.
 * If you are benchmarking on Freebsd, you may need to use `gmake`.

contributing
------------

Contributions and pull requests are always welcome. If you are submitting a pull request with benchmark data, please include the value of OLD and NEW at the top of the Makefile in the suffix of your file (follow the examples) so we can trace which revision this benchmark was taken from. If you want to include commentary in your benchmark, comments should start with a #.
